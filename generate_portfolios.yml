        Think step-by-step. 

        First, identify major changes and trends in the market environment
        described in the report.

        Second, use these insights to develop several aggressive investment hypotheses
        taking advantage of these changes and trends.

        Third, translate these hypotheses into an aggressive growth investment portfolio
        consisting of stocks or ETFs or both. Use only stocks and ETFs that are publicly traded
        on NASDAQ and NYSE in the US. Do not include any other asset classes.

        Do not show results of any intermediate steps. Show only the final result.
        Return the result of the final step as a portfolio in JSON format.
